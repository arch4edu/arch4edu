Subject: [PATCH 2/2] [sanitizer_common] Remove reference to obsolete termio
 ioctls (#138822)
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Cherry picked from LLVM commit c99b1bcd505064f2e086e6b1034ce0b0c91ea5b9.

The termio ioctls are no longer used after commit 59978b21ad9c
("[sanitizer_common] Remove interceptors for deprecated struct termio
(#137403)"), remove them.  Fixes this build error:
