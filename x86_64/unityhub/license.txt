5.1 Fees

Fees for certain Services are set forth on the Site or via the service panel in the Software (the “Service Panel”). Unity may increase, modify or add new fees and charges for any of the Services from time to time by posting such changes to the Site or within the Services Panel. Unity will provide you with at least 30 days’ notice of any changes affecting existing Software and/or Developer Services you have already started using, and your continued use of such Software and/or Developer Service after the effective date of any such change means that you accept and agree to such changes, as applicable.

You agree to pay all amounts due for the Services as set forth in the online cart, quote or invoice and in accordance with Unity's payment terms and, if applicable, those of any payment processor. If any payment is not made on time, Unity may deactivate your access to the Services.

Payments made under the Agreement shall be made without deduction or set-off for any withholding taxes, levies, imports, duties, charges and/or fees imposed by any governmental taxing authority except as required by law. If you are compelled to make any such deduction, you will pay to Unity such additional amounts as are necessary to ensure Unity's receipt of the full amount that Unity would have received but for the deduction. You will be responsible for, and agree to promptly pay, all taxes or duties of any kind (including but not limited to sales, use and withholding taxes) associated with any purchase or your receipt or use of the Services, except for taxes based on Unity’s net income. In the event that Unity is required to collect any tax for which you are responsible, you will pay such tax directly to Unity or its payment processor. Unity reserves the right to collect any applicable sales, use or value added tax.

All sales are final and there shall be no refunds except as required by law. Further, Unity will not allow changes to your purchase after you complete it. Unity may disable all copies of the Software and/or your access to any Services you have licensed or subscribed to in the event you fail to make all payments when due.

You acknowledge and agree that, in the case of certain Services, any estimates of fees and charges provided to you by Unity (whether based on assumed data consumption or otherwise) are solely estimates based on assumptions and that you are fully responsible for the actual fees and charges that accrue.

5.2 Billing

If you purchase Services, you will be asked to provide customary billing information, such as name, company name, billing address, credit card information, and VAT or GST number, either to Unity or its third party payment processor.

When you provide billing information to Unity or its third party payment processor, you: (i) represent and warrant that you are the authorized user of the card, PIN, key or account associated with such billing information; (ii) agree to pay Unity for all purchases (including all applicable taxes) made via the Site or Services Panel; and (iii) thereby authorize Unity or its third party payment processor to charge your credit card or otherwise process your payment for any purchase, subscription or other fees incurred by you. If you are directed to Unity’s third party payment processor, you may be subject to terms and conditions governing use of that third party’s service and that third party’s privacy policy. Please review such third party’s terms and conditions and privacy policy before using such services.

5.3 Subscription Terms

Any subscriptions you purchase will remain in effect for the initial subscription period, and thereafter will automatically renew at the then-current list price, unless you terminate and cancel it as described on the Site.

To ensure compliance with the Agreement, you agree that within ten (10) days from the date of Unity or its authorized representative’s request, you shall provide all pertinent records and information requested in order to verify that your installation and use of any and all Services is in compliance with the Agreement along with a signed verification that all such information is complete and correct. Furthermore, if you are a Legal Entity, Unity or its authorized representatives may upon reasonable prior notice access and inspect your facilities and computer systems to review and verify your compliance with the Agreement. Any such inspection shall be conducted during regular business hours at your facilities or electronically via remote access. In the event you have impermissibly used Unity Personal (or other products) or have not paid the applicable fees for all Services you have deployed or used, you agree to immediately pay for such Services, as well as the reasonable inspection costs, upon Unity’s demand.

7. Termination And Account Cancellation

Unity will have the right in its sole discretion, and without prior notice to you, to suspend or disable your Unity Account or terminate the Agreement and/or your right or ability to access or use any of the Services if: (a) you breach this Agreement; (b) your use of the Services poses a security risk to, or otherwise adversely impacts, the Services or any third party; (c) your use of the Services subjects Unity, our affiliates or any third party to liability; (d) your use of the Services may be fraudulent; (e) you have ceased to operate in the ordinary course, made an assignment for the benefit of creditors or similar disposition of your assets, or become the subject of any bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or similar proceeding.

In the event of any suspension, disablement or termination, you acknowledge that: (i) Unity will have no further obligation to provide the Services to you; (ii) all rights granted to you under the Agreement will immediately cease; (iii) you may no longer access any of Your Content that was previously submitted via any of the Services or that was related to your Unity Account, and Unity will have no obligation to maintain or forward you Your Content; and (iv) you will remain liable for all fees and charges for all Services ordered.

11. Controlling Law and Jurisdiction

11.1 Choice Of Law

The Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Denmark, without regard to or application of conflict of laws rules or principles. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply.

11.2 Arbitration

Except as set forth below in Section 11.3, any dispute arising out of or in connection with the Agreement, including any disputes regarding the existence, validity or termination thereof, shall be settled by arbitration. The parties agree to arbitrate all disputes by simplified arbitration arranged by The Danish Institute of Arbitration in accordance with the rules of simplified arbitration procedure adopted by The Danish Institute of Arbitration and in force at the time when such proceedings are commenced. The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. You and unity agree that each may bring claims against the other only in your or its individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.

11.3 Arbitration Exceptions

Notwithstanding the parties’ agreement to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring an action in court: (a) to enforce its intellectual property rights (“intellectual property rights” means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights), including without limitation to seek injunctive relief; (b) in cases that do not involve intellectual property rights, to seek temporary, preliminary or other expedited or provisional injunctive relief (but not money damages); or (c) collect fees due pursuant to the Agreement. If you reside (or your principal place of business is) within the United States and the parties have an intellectual property rights dispute, you and Unity agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of and venue in the state and federal courts located in San Francisco County, California. If you reside (or your principal place of business is) outside of the United States and the parties have an intellectual property rights dispute, you and Unity agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of and venue in the courts located in Copenhagen, Denmark. The parties agree to accept service of process by mail, and hereby waive any and all jurisdictional and venue defenses otherwise available.

12. General

The Agreement is the complete and exclusive understanding and agreement between the parties regarding its subject matter, and supersedes all proposals, understandings or communications between the parties, oral or written, regarding its subject matter, unless you and Unity have executed a separate agreement governing your use of the Services, in which case such separate agreement(s) will control in relation to the relevant Services. The English language version of the Agreement is legally binding in case of any inconsistencies between the English version and any translations. Any terms or conditions contained in your purchase order or other ordering document that are inconsistent with or in addition to the terms and conditions of the Agreement are hereby rejected by Unity and will be deemed null. You may not assign or transfer the Agreement or any rights granted hereunder, by operation of law or otherwise, without Unity’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to do so, without such consent, will be void. Unity may assign or transfer the Agreement, at its sole discretion, without restriction. Unity may assign your User account for collection, and the collection agency may pursue claims limited to the collection of past due and owing amount and any interest or cost of collection permitted by law or the Agreement in any court of competent jurisdiction. Subject to the foregoing, the Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns. Except as expressly set forth in the Agreement, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under the Agreement will be without prejudice to its other remedies under the Agreement or otherwise. Unity will deliver all notices, approvals or other communications required or permitted under the Agreement, including those regarding modifications to the Agreement: (a) via e-mail (in each case to the address that you provide); or (ii) by posting to the Site, the Service Panel or your Unity Account. For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted. The failure by either party to enforce any provision of the Agreement will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision. Any waiver, modification or amendment of any provision of the Agreement will be effective only if in writing and signed by authorized representatives of both parties. If any provision of the Agreement is held to be unenforceable or invalid that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent possible and the other provisions will remain in full force and effect.
