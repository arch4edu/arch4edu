# Changelog

## 5.13.0 (2026-08-13)

- Updated pdfium-binaries from `7947` to `7999`. Additional builds may use various other versions of pdfium.
- Experimental ``pyemscripten_2026_0_wasm32`` (Pyodide) build support added. *However, the resulting builds are flaky at runtime and subject to various types of random crashes. Freezes on shutdown have also been observed.*<br>
  While these issues persist, PyEmscripten wheels will not be uploaded to PyPI, but they are included in the release process and can be downloaded from GitHub on an experimental basis.
  If you can help track down and fix these issues, please reach out.<br>
  Note: Our PyEmscripten wheels are bigger than usual, as they are built with debug symbols (a non-debug build is not considered useful at this stage).
- Fixed compatibility with Python 3.6 and 3.7.
  * Runtime support was inadvertently broken due to a faulty cached property backport which held only one cache per class, not per instance as should have been.
    The accidental loss of caches broke key assumptions of our autoclose logic, which relies on `cached_property` since 5.8.0. (Earlier versions that did not make extensive use of cached properties might work but have not been explicitly tested.)
  * This release replaces both `functools.cached_property` and the faulty `functools.lru_cache()` based backport with our own, backward compatible `cached_property` implementation along with thorough documentation.
  * Also, fixed setup (i.e. source installation) with Python 3.6 and its max available setup dependency versions (that is, `setuptools` 59). This had probably been broken for a long time. (A few non-breaking issues remain, e.g. for some reason we end up with a `purelib` directory, but it should be `platlib`.)
  * Bear in mind that ctypesgen continues to require Python `>=3.8` at this time (3.6 compat not being a priority in that case), but you can install with `--no-build-isolation` and let the reference bindings be used, or try adding ctypesgen's `src/` to `PYTHONPATH` to bypass setup, and see how it goes.
  * **Note: We do not plan to (and practically cannot) keep up compatibility with outdated Python versions indefinitely.** In particular, setup compatibility may be dropped sooner or later in favor of contemporary Python packaging concepts, like migrating as much as possible to `pyproject.toml`. That said, we are happy to restore compatibility at this point, and fix any *unintentional* breakage.
- Fixed `MANIFEST.in` missing Windows spoof headers, which resulted in subtly incorrect bindings when installing from an sdist on Windows, as seen in test failures. (Release wheels have been unaffected and passed the test suite, so this issue went unnoticed for a while.)
- Bumped `gn-dist` from `2407.1` to `2407.3`. Made its setup python 3.6 compatible likewise (wheels should have worked before now). Changed versioning and release process so that CI no longer needs to push to the repository (may eventually become a blueprint for pypdfium2 itself). More documentation added, including `manylinux2014` POC.
- Internal improvements (non-exhaustive):
  * Properly clean up `*.egg-info/` and `build/` before packaging, to avoid mad file inclusion bugs (ran into this while working on setup include rules).
  * Migrated from requirements files to PEP 735 dependency groups (`pyproject.toml`).
    Recent enough `pip` should be available to Python >= 3.9. For compatibility with older versions, feel free to use `./utils/misc/install_dep_group.py`.
  * Applied dependency cooldowns to internal callers of `pip install`. Always use virtual environments in CI. Use lockfiles in sensitive areas (e.g. publish jobs).
  * Rearranged & improved utilities. Cleaner distinction between `setupsrc/` and `utils/`.
  * Work around persistent i686 container network issues by downgrading host runner to `ubuntu-24.04`.
  * Let `setupsrc/` share code from `src/` through a `pypdfium2_cfg._shared` submodule that can be added to `sys.path`.


## 5.12.1 (2026-07-17)

- No pdfium-binaries update, still at `7947`. Additional builds may use various other versions of pdfium.
- Fix missing mkdir call in bindings build (blunder). This particularly matters for `PDFIUM_PLATFORM=system-search` / fallback setup.


## 5.12.0 (2026-07-15)

*__NOTE__: This release has been yanked from PyPI. 5.12.1 is the drop-in replacement, which fixes a setup blunder but is otherwise identical to 5.12.0.*

- Updated pdfium-binaries from `7920` to `7947`. Additional builds may use various other versions of pdfium.

*Requirements*
- macOS `13.0+` is now required for current PDFium (declared in upstream config and confirmed with dylib header inspection). Updated wheel tags accordingly.
- Setup: Increased tool dependency requirements
  + `build_native.py` now expects `git >= 2.49.0` so we can use modern `git clone --revision` features.
  + If `gh` is installed, `gh >= 2.47.0` will be required, as we now assume availability of the `gh attestation` subcommand without consulting `gh --version`.

*Packaging / CI*

Largest CI/workflows rework yet ("Strategic builds"). Many testing gaps filled (see the updated platform support table).
- Dynamic selection of targets and Python versions across 3 build strategies (pdfium-binaries, `build_toolchained.py`, cibuildwheel/`build_native.py`). This means releases can now be made using any selection of targets/strategies, configurable through workflow inputs on a per-run basis.
- In principle, this would allow us to make releases just using our own builds, without external binaries. We plan to explore this from time to time. That said, pypdfium2's conda packages continue to be tied to the pdfium-binaries, and setup will continue to provide you with pdfium-binaries by default.
- Test multiple Python versions in one job (either the build job, or a dedicated test job if another runner image is needed). Share testing across build strategies through composite action / reusable workflow. Use Docker testing where needed. Added ability to test macOS Intel from arm64 through Rosetta emulation (`arch -x86_64` prefix).
- Split up pdfium-binaries packaging in individual jobs.
- Hash-pinned all actions across `pypdfium2`, `gn-dist` and the `ctypesgen` fork. Tightened permissions. Replaced superfluous actions with built-in `gh` CLI. Use exact commit hash rather than branch name to transfer state between jobs. `zizmor` compliance (with a few intentional suppressions).

*Setup*
- With 32-bit interpreters running on 64-bit hosts, setup should now select the 32-bit target.
- With pdfium-binaries, use (and cache) the included pdfium headers.
  In most cases, this should let us avoid upstream Gitiles, which turns out to be flaky in automated access.


## 5.11.0 (2026-06-29)

- Updated pdfium-binaries from `7891` to `7920`. Additional builds may use various other versions of pdfium.
- Build scripts: Updated PDFium pin from `7891` to `7913`.
- New `PdfBookmark.get_color()` helper added. This is based on upstream's new `FPDFBookmark_GetColor()` API. Integrated `get_color()` into `pypdfium2 toc` CLI.
  Thanks to Aryan Krishnan for the upstream part.
  * **Note:** Since conda pdfium-binaries are built on a slower schedule (to preserve storage space), this new API is not available to conda users just yet, but once new pdfium-binaries are out, we will re-upload this release to conda with incremented build number & different pdfium version bounds. (Backward compatibility is provided, i.e. internal call sites like `pypdfium2 toc` will not attempt to call `get_color()` with older pdfium.)
  * **Update (2026-07-07):** Released new conda builds as promised.
- New platforms: `manylinux_2_17_{mips64le,mipsle}` wheels added to release.
  * `build_toolchained.py` is now capable of building these, based on upstream's `mips64el` and `mipsel` targets (with minor patches). This took a great deal of tinkering, however.
  * Like `loongarch64`, PyPI does not accept MIPS wheels (yet), so they are only released to GitHub.
  * Note that `pip` actually rejects our wheels because MIPS is not officially part of the manylinux standard and thus not contained in pip's internal whitelist. This can be remedied by re-tagging with `wheel` locally to match the host's `sysconfig.get_platform()` value. See [pip ticket #14095](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/14095) for more info.
  * The `mipsle` build is untested (apart from `file` showing the correct target signature), for lack of a container image and binfmt handler.
- Docs: Comprehensive [platform support table](https://pypdfium2-team.github.io/pypdfium2/platforms.html) added – check it out!
- Setup: Auto-detect minimum required macOS and iOS versions using `macholib`, which actually runs cross-platform.
  This corrects the `iOS` min version to `26_0`. (We do not currently publish iOS wheels but it is handled in setup.)
- Work around a bindings generation issue on Windows by avoiding inclusion of system `windows.h`.
- Honor reference bindings properly: don't download headers or reuse cached bindings.
  Make test suite pass when reference bindings are used.
- Fix conda packaging of `pypdfium2_raw`, which was broken by setup changes in 5.10.
  The root issue in setup with `PYPDFIUM_MODULES=raw` now requiring a pre-generated version file remains, though.
- `sbuild_one.yaml` now also tests Linux targets in Docker, to make sure cross-compiled builds actually work.
- Start using `ubuntu-26.04` runners. Some workflows intentionally stick with `ubuntu-24.04` for the time being so we can keep testing older Python versions.
- `get_cross_deps.py`: Use GCC 16 on `ubuntu-26.04`, and GCC 14 on `ubuntu-24.04`.
- Put up a notice that AI issues/PRs are banned from this project, and updated templates accordingly.
  Any users who continue to file AI issues will be blocked.
  After half a dozen consecutive issues and PRs full of confusion, bloat and wildly invented false claims, which nearly all turned out to have been produced by Claude Code, we feel compelled to take this step.
  **If you encounter an issue, our condition for your chance to have us investigate (and hopefully fix) your issue is that you must act respectfully and provide a workable bug report without any AI involvement.**
  TLDR pypdfium2's issue tracker is not a waste deposit for AI garbage.


## 5.10.1 (2026-06-15)

- Updated pdfium-binaries from `7869` to `7891`. Additional builds may use various other versions of pdfium.
- The previous release failed to upload to PyPI (see below). This release fixes the publish issue but is effectively identical to `5.10.0`. Due to tag protection from immutable releases, `5.10.0` cannot be deleted.

*Dependency updates*
- Updated `build_toolchained.py` PDFium pin from `7191` to `7891`. Despite the gap, this turned out fairly straightforward.
- Updated `build_native.py` PDFium pin from `7841` to `7891`.
- Updated `gn-dist` from `2385` to `2407.1`, to match the revision specified in upstream's `DEPS` file.
- Updated cibuildwheel to `4.1.0`.
- Let `install-static-clang.sh` use latest.
- We now try to track latest PDFium in CIBW targets that use `build_native.py` with GCC, as this mode needs few patches.
  In releases, this affects `musllinux_{x86_64,i686,aarch64,armv7l}`. Let's see how this goes.
  If it breaks too often, we may go back to the pinned version or even `pdfium-binaries` for some musl targets.

*Packaging*
- Corrected minimum macOS requirement to `12_0`, as determined by `vtool -show-build`.
- Lowered `riscv64` wheel's glibc requirement from `2_38` to `2_34` by using upstream's sysroot.

*API changes*
- Fixed a long-standing issue concerning formenv autoclose logic.
  `PdfDocument` stores the formenv, but `PdfFormEnv` referenced back to the parent `PdfDocument` including in the formenv's finalizer, forming a reference circle / indirect self-reference. This is illegal with `weakref.finalize()`.
  Addressing this issue properly required some changes to the public API:
  * `PdfFormEnv`: The `pdf` attribute and `parent` alias have been removed. Since `pdf` is created on the caller side, it is expected that callers would access their object directly rather than through the formenv.
  * Formenv lifetime is now managed through `PdfDocument`.
    `PdfFormEnv.close()` has been deprecated and is now a no-op. It is superseded by the new `PdfDocument.close_forms()` API.
  * `PdfPage.parent` now always points to a `PdfDocument`, not sometimes a `PdfFormEnv`.
    Conversely, page weakrefs are always stored on `PdfDocument`, not sometimes on `PdfFormEnv`.
  
  We are aware that, technically, this is an API-breaking change, but it has been decided not to increment the major version, given that `PdfFormEnv`'s `pdf` and `parent` attributes are insignificant to most callers, and removing them helps fix a real issue.
  
  The exact consequences of this self-reference are yet unclear to us, but memory leaks (due to finalizers not being called) and/or corruption seem possible.
  Thanks to `@noxthot` for a report that triggered this investigation.

*Setup, Build scripts & Workflows*
- Finally, prevent custom setup code from running multiple times in `pip install` by deferring data files generation into `build_py`, as suggested in cibuildwheel FAQ.
  Also, make the DLL path available to the tagging stage.
  This took some refactoring the control flow.
- `build_toolchained.py`: Significantly improved code style. In `PORTABLE_MODE`, added ability to use a sysroot and/or clang (requires passing `--clang-path ...`). Fix `install_buildtools()` by calling it before any depot_tools wrappers are added to `PATH`.
- Pragmatic `build_native.py` changes to make updating a bit more feasible:
  Patches for legacy GN and the transitional `--no-legacy-gn` option have been removed; recent GN is now required.
  Clang patches now just aim for compatibility with clang >= 22, much reducing patch complexity. For clang versions older than that, `--clang-as-gcc` mode is implicitly enabled.
  More patches have been simplified, removed, changed to autopatch or upstreamed (pending removal, need to await dependency rolls).
  Overall, `build_native.py` is now more focused on producing builds with cibuildwheel; maintainability and easier updates are prioritized over excess compatibility with older dependencies. Basically, we will require what pdfium requires.
- On Linux with glibc, `build_native.py` is now capable of using a sysroot. With our current cibuildwheel config, this can be used to lower the glibc requirements of `manylinux_{ppc64le,riscv64,armv7l}` (opt-in via `USE_SYSROOT=1`).
- Made the PDFium version configurable in cibuildwheel config and workflows.
- Added `secrets: inherit` to `trigger_conda_raw.yaml` to hopefully fix a publish issue caused by the change to reusable workflow calls.
- Other setup improvements. Use plain `git` instead of GH API to get the ctypesgen revision. Drastically speed up attestation verification by sharing the trusted root.


## 5.10.0 (2026-06-15)

- PyPI upload of this release failed, due to an obscure issue with `pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish` being incompatible with reusable workflow calls. It will be immediately superseded by `5.10.1`.


## 5.9.0 (2026-06-01)

- Updated pdfium-binaries from `7825` to `7869`. Native and toolchained sourcebuild use pdfium `7841` and `7191`, respectively.
- Finally updated native sourcebuild from pdfium `7191` to `7841`.
  Updating the script & patches, and tracking down any issues that cropped up, adding new patches to fix them, turned out to be a great deal of work.
- Created `gn-dist` project providing recent builds of GN (`generate-ninja`) for Linux (glibc and musl, full set of architectures).
  Updated pypdfium2's cibuildwheel config and workflows accordingly to use `gn-dist` rather than outdated distro packages of GN.
  Scripting to build GN from source previously included in pypdfium2's setup has moved to `gn-dist`.
  In `build_native.py`, patches for legacy GN are still included and enabled by default for now, but you can pass `--no-legacy-gn` to skip them.
  To make updating more straightforward, this mode will be made default and the patches will be removed in the future.
- In cibuildwheel config, pass `-xn` to the build frontend to make `before-build` usable to install PyPI dependencies such as `gn-dist` (which we do not want to have in the main `pyproject.toml [build-system] requires`).
- Workflows overhaul.
  * Deduplicated `workflow_dispatch` and `workflow_call` inputs using YAML anchors & aliases (available on GHA since 09/2025).
  * Replaced `benc-uk/workflow-dispatch` action with reusable workflow calls.
  * Deduplicated series of individual jobs by switching to matrices. Handle `if`-conditions through an input parameter to the called workflow, because (unlike jobs) matrix entries have no built-in conditionality.
  * Updated to Python `3.14` (mostly). Simplified test matrices to probe just a few Python versions (e.g. `3.8, 3.11, 3.14`).
- Limited who has maintainer access to the repo and project sites.
  `mara004`, the author and so far only active committer of pypdfium2, now is (and will remain) sole owner.
  Inactive co-maintainers no longer have access, but are welcome to submit PRs.
  In the event of the author being unable to pursue this project further, it can be forked and a new maintainer may build their own trust, but given the risks inherent to maintainer changes, it has been decided that pypdfium2 will remain `mara004`'s personal project. The existing userbase will not be handed over to another maintainer.


## 5.8.0 (2026-05-04)

- Updated pdfium-binaries from `7802` to `7825`. Native and toolchained sourcebuild use pdfium `7191`.
- Autoclose machinery update.
  + Encapsulate finalizer state in a mutable object.
  + Objects now remove themselves from their parent's kids cache on garbage collection / closing, to avoid accumulation.
  + Global `ObjectTracker` added (objects are grouped by type and remove themselves from the tracker on finalization likewise). This may allow to destroy and re-initalize the library during a session.
  + Fixed some issues and inconsistencies in autoclose hooks that were unmasked by the above changes.
    * `PdfDocument.page_as_xobject()` now registers the XObject as a child of `dest_pdf` rather than `self`.
    * Mark pageobjects (`PdfObject`) as untracked.
    * For pages registered as kids of a formenv, `PdfPage.parent` now points at the formenv.
      This means the `.parent` property should be seen as purely an autoclose hook and not something to use for other purposes.
    * Fixed a test case to use `_detach_finalizer()` instead of `_finalizer.detach()`.
  + Changed `DEBUG_AUTOCLOSE` to hold a loglevel rather than just a bool. This lets us distinguish between noisy debug messages and actual warnings. The default level is now `logging.WARNING`.
  + Should any issues surface with these changes (e.g. hitting assertions, or performance concerns), please let us know. Provide logs with autoclose debugging enabled if applicable.
- `PdfPage.get_objects()`: Added `textpage` passthrough parameter. This is required for `PdfTextObj.extract()`. Raise a meaningful exception if the textpage is missing. Demonstrate `.extract()` in pageobjects CLI.
- `PdfFont.get_base_name()`, `.get_family_name()`: decoding `errors` option added, now defaults to `"replace"`.
- New helpers `PdfFont.load_standard()`, `.STANDARD_FONTS` and `PdfDefaultTTFMap` added.
- Errchecks added to `PdfPage.get_rotation()`, `.insert_obj()` and `PdfUnspHandler.setup()`.
- New font diagnostic CLIs added (`pypdfium2 fonts` and `default-fonts`). Optional dependency `tabulate`.
- In the CLI dispatcher, try to load only the module that is actually used.
- CLI / `setup_logging()`: Fix warnings to be shown by removing an incorrect `logging.captureWarnings(True)` (that would require configuring the `py.warnings` logger or root logger). Instead, use just `warnings.simplefilter("always")` for now.
  Also, fix `DEBUG_SYSFONTS` being a boolean option. Share streamhandler across loggers.


## 5.7.1 (2026-04-20)

- Updated pdfium-binaries from `7776` to `7802`. Native and toolchained sourcebuild use pdfium `7191`.
- The pdfium update fixes a regression in `FPDFText_GetLooseCharBox()` / `PdfTextPage.get_charbox(i, loose=True)` results introduced in the previous release.
  (Since conda pdfium-binaries are updated only once a month, this release downgrades to pdfium `7713` on conda)
- Fixed an oversight in the CLI that caused `pypdfium2.__init__` to run before preparation after all. This had regressed shortly before the previous release.
 `DEBUG_AUTOCLOSE=1 pypdfium2 -h` should now show `Initialize PDFium` at first.
- Changed output string handling once more, as even slicing the buffer directly still implies a copy – so let's use `memoryview` and `codecs.decode()` instead.
  Also, we now create buffers of the expected type directly to avoid casts, and convert number of bytes to units via ceil division where needed.
  Updated the Readme's raw API examples accordingly.
- `PdfTextPage.get_text_bounded()` no longer unconditionally calls `page.get_bbox()` each time. Instead, call it only if needed, when at least one of the boundary values is None.
  If all bounds are given, skip the call. This eliminates extra overhead when `get_text_bounded()` is called many times on given rectangles, like from `PdfTextPage.get_rect()`. Though the API probably is not meant to be used this way.
  Consider `PdfPage.get_objects(filter=(FPDF_PAGEOBJ_TEXT,))` and `textobj.extract()` as a possible alternative.
- Added `PdfFont.is_embedded` property.


## 5.7.0 (2026-04-08)

- Updated pdfium-binaries from `7713` to `7776`. Native and toolchained sourcebuild use pdfium `7191`.
- `PdfDocument`: When encoding input filepath to `UTF-8`, use the `surrogateescape` error handler (except on Windows).
  This fixes loading some garbled filenames, where a default `.encode("utf-8")` call would raise `UnicodeEncodeError`. Thanks to Filipe Litaiff for the report.
- Simplified output string handling. Access `buffer` directly instead of `buffer.raw`.
- The CLI has moved from `pypdfium2._cli` to `pypdfium2_cli`, i.e. an own submodule.
  `pypdfium2.__main__` and `python3 -m pypdfium2` are deprecated. Use `pypdfium2_cli.__main__` and `python3 -m pypdfium2_cli` or the `pypdfium2` entrypoint instead.
  This has been necessary since a module's `__main__.py` implies its `__init__.py`, which gives us no chance to prepare before library init if `__main__.py` lives in the `pypdfium2` module itself.
- Added new helper `PdfSysfontBase`. Wraps `FPDF_SYSFONTINFO` and related APIs.
  Callers can subclass from `PdfSysfontBase` to inspect or alter the way PDFium uses system fonts.
  This is a first step towards implementing a warning mechanism for missing system fonts or substitution.
  Thanks to `scyyh11` for related proposals, and especially a hint on passing the right pointer in callbacks.
- Added `PdfiumWarning` (subclass of `Warning`). A `PdfiumWarning` is now issued on XFA forms load failure, with programmatic error code info, rather than just a log message.
- Added new submodule stub `pypdfium2_cfg`, which can be imported before `pypdfium2` for init-time configuration. The `DEBUG_AUTOCLOSE` setting has been moved to this module.
  In the future, `pypdfium2_cfg` may be extended to give callers control over how pypdfium2 initializes PDFium (e.g. custom font paths).
- Split off `pypdfium2_raw/version.py` from `pypdfium2/version.py`, so that `PDFIUM_INFO` is now available from within `pypdfium2_raw`.
  This has been necessary to implement a target-specific workaround (see below).
- `build_native.py`: When GCC is used, we now declare a `custom_toolchain`, with environment passthrough.
   * First, this avoids inconsistency across different platforms in pdfium's build config, with some expecting just `gcc` and others an arch-prefixed variant.
     This makes `build_native.py` more likely to work out of the box, relieving callers from the necessity to create symlinks, including our internal cibuildwheel callers.
   * Second, this allows you to use a different version of GCC, or in fact any other compatible compiler, including clang, by setting `CC`, `CXX` and `TOOLPREFIX`.
     This makes `--clang-as-gcc` more straightforward to implement.
   * Also, extra `CFLAGS`, `CPPFLAGS`, `CXXFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS` are now honored in this build mode.
- Basic FreeBSD CI added (powered by `cross-platform-actions`), testing installation with libreoffice-pdfium.
  - On (Free)BSD with libreoffice-pdfium, pre-load implicit dependency libraries with `mode=RTLD_GLOBAL` to fix library load.


## 5.6.0 (2026-03-08)

- Updated pdfium-binaries from `7690` to `7713`. Native and toolchained sourcebuild use pdfium `7191`.
- In our cibuildwheel workflow, all targets now exercise pypdfium2's test suite. This is implemented as a custom post-cibuildwheel step, using Debian 13 or Alpine 3 containers, respectively. Note, there are known test failures on s390x and musllinux_armv7l (but we still provide builds). In particular, on s390x, opening password-protected PDFs is broken. s390x is "use at own risk"; there is absolutely no warranty.
- Other workflow and cibuildwheel config improvements.


## 5.5.0 (2026-02-18)

- Updated pdfium-binaries from `7665` to `7690`. Native and toolchained sourcebuild use pdfium `7191`.
- Windows-only members are now included in bindings where applicable. Thanks to `NullYing` for an incentive to fix this.
  Callers who want to use this API, note: it is strongly recommended that you `ctypes.cast()` the HDC object created on your side to our internal `pypdfium2.raw.HDC` before passing it into `FPDF_RenderPage()` to ensure compatible types regardless of how the bindings were generated.
- `build_native.py` improvements
  * `--reset` now does `git restore .` rather than `git reset --hard`. This might be more efficient.
  * When `--test` is given, honor the unittests' return code. Suppress a musl-specific failure. Fixed `pdfium_unittests` not running on musl with clang by applying a build patch.
  * Added `--clang-as-gcc` option to build with clang while pretending to pdfium's build system it were gcc. This mode is now used to build for `s390x` with static clang.
- Bumped static clang from `21.1.6.0` to `21.1.8.1`.
- On Windows and macOS, fallback setup now uses the toolchained sourcebuild.
- Made a textpage test case more tolerant, as pdfium update has changed the result.


## 5.4.0 (2026-02-08)

- Updated pdfium-binaries from `7616` to `7665`. Native and toolchained sourcebuild use pdfium `7191`.


## 5.3.0 (2026-01-05)

- Updated pdfium-binaries from `7568` to `7616`. Native and toolchained sourcebuild use pdfium `7191`.
- Fixed inclusion of `loongarch64` build in GH attestation. This was an oversight in the workflow.
- `ppc64le (glibc)` is now built at pdfium-binaries using upstream's tooling.
  This means pypdfium2's conda builds now also support this platform.
  Updated pypdfium2's setup/workflow accordingly to use the pdfium-binaries.


## 5.2.0 (2025-12-12)

- Updated pdfium-binaries from `7557` to `7568`. Native and toolchained sourcebuild use pdfium `7191`.
- Added new builds `android_{arm64_v8a,armeabi_v7a}`, `{many,musl}linux_{ppc64le,riscv64,loongarch64}` and `musllinux_armv7l` to the release process. This greatly improves platform support. Loongarch is only uploaded to GH, as PyPI doesn't accept it yet. Replaced `musllinux_{x86_64,aarch64,i686}` with our own builds, as they are a bit smaller than the pdfium-binaries.
- Build `s390x` this once through emulated gcc, because static clang doesn't seem to produce working builds for this target. We may not be able to continue doing this.
- `build_native.py`: Added full dependency library vendoring abilities. This is now the default behavior on fallback setup. Integrated ninja/gn bootstrapping helpers.
- CIBW workflow: Use vendored libraries for most Linux targets. Build `ppc64le, riscv64, loongarch64` (and theoretically `s390x`) using static clang that runs on the host architecture (even though from within an emulated container), while being pre-configured for cross-compilation to the target architecture. This is much faster than building with an emulated compiler. Many thanks to Matthieu Darbois (mayeut) of pypa/manylinux for coming up with this approach.
- Greatly simplified verification of pdfium-binaries attestation in pypdfium2's setup. Thanks to Benoît Blanchon for attaching the attestation as artifact.
- Enabled immutability for pypdfium2's GitHub releases, and added build provenance attestations, like pdfium-binaries did.


## 5.2.0b1 (2025-12-02)

- Updated PDFium from `7529` to `7557`.
- See the beta release notes on GitHub [here](https://github.com/pypdfium2-team/pypdfium2/releases/tag/5.2.0b1)


## 5.1.0 (2025-11-23)

- Updated PDFium from `7483` to `7529`.
- Added new helpers `textpage.get_textobj()`, `PdfTextObj` and `PdfFont`.
  These helpers currently just cover font info and object-level text extraction, but may be extended in the future.
  For objects of type `FPDF_PAGEOBJ_TEXT`, `PdfPage.get_objects()` and the `PdfObject` constructor will now return `PdfTextObj` rather than just `PdfObject` instances.
  Thanks to Mykola Skrynnyk for the initial proposal.
  <!-- See #392, #391, #358, #325 -->
- Rolled back `musllinux` tag from `1_2` to `1_1`. This was erroneously incremented shortly before `5.0.0`, but the pdfium-binaries do still run on `musllinux_1_1`, probably because they're statically linked.
- `build_toolchained`: Significant portability enhancements. Should now work on Linux CPUs that are unhandled/incomplete upstream (e.g. `aarch64`). Also, building on Windows arm64 natively may now work. Added ability to cross-compile `ppc64le` from `x86_64`. Removed `--use-syslibs` option (use `build_native` instead).
- `build_native`: Fixed Python 3.6/3.7 compatibility. Added `--no-libclang-rt` option.
- Setup: Fixed inclusion of `BUILD_LICENSES/` sub-directories. Added extra licenses for DLLs pulled in by auditwheel. This concerns sourcebuilds/cibuildwheel only. The wheels on PyPI are unaffected.
- Added android targets to `sbuild.yaml` workflow. This does not impact releases, which still use the pdfium-binaries.
- Added i686 (manylinux and musllinux) to cibuildwheel workflow.
  Use an arm64 host (GHA `ubuntu-24.04-arm`) for armv7l builds, which is much faster than with an `x86_64` host. Added armv7l manylinux target (previously just musllinux).
  This does not impact releases yet, but it may in the future.
- CI: Migrated from `macos-13` to `macos-15-intel`.


## 5.0.0 (2025-10-26)

*API changes*
- Rendering / Bitmap
  * Removed `PdfDocument.render()` (see deprecation rationale in v4.25 changelog). Instead, use `PdfPage.render()` with a loop or process pool.
  * Removed `PdfBitmap.get_info()` and `PdfBitmapInfo`, which existed mainly on behalf of data transfer with `PdfDocument.render()`. Instead, take the info from the `PdfBitmap` object directly. (If using an adapter that copies, you may want to store the relevant info in variables to avoid holding a reference to the original buffer.)
  * `PdfBitmap.fill_rect()`: Changed argument order. The `color` parameter now goes first.
  * `PdfBitmap.to_numpy()`: If the bitmap is single-channel (grayscale), use a 2d shape to avoid needlessly wrapping each pixel value in a list.
  * `PdfBitmap.from_pil()`: Removed `recopy` parameter.
- Pageobjects
  * Renamed `PdfObject.get_pos()` to `.get_bounds()`.
  * Renamed `PdfImage.get_size()` to `.get_px_size()`.
  * `PdfImage.extract()`: Removed `fb_render` option because it does not fit in this API. If the image's rendered bitmap is desired, use `.get_bitmap(render=True)` in the first place.
- `PdfDocument.get_toc()`: Replaced `PdfOutlineItem` namedtuple with method-oriented wrapper classes `PdfBookmark` and `PdfDest`, so callers may retrieve only the properties they actually need. This is closer to pdfium's original API and exposes the underlying raw objects. Provides signed count as-is rather than splitting in `n_kids` and `is_closed`. Also distinguishes between `dest is None` and a dest with unknown mode.
- Renamed misleading `PdfMatrix.mirror()` parameters `v, h` to `invert_x, invert_y`, as the terms horizontal/vertical flip commonly refer to the transformation applied, not the axis around which is being flipped (i.e. the previous `v` meant flipping around the Y axis, which is vertical, but the resulting transform is inverting the X coordinates and thus actually horizontal). No behavior change if you did not use keyword arguments.
- `PdfTextPage.get_text_range()`: Removed implicit translation of default calls to `.get_text_bounded()`, as pdfium reverted `FPDFText_GetText()` to UCS-2, which resolves the allocation concern. However, callers are encouraged to explicitly use `.get_text_bounded()` for full Unicode support.
- Removed legacy version flags `V_PYPDFIUM2, V_LIBPDFIUM, V_BUILDNAME, V_PDFIUM_IS_V8, V_LIBPDFIUM_FULL` in favor of `PYPDFIUM_INFO, PDFIUM_INFO`.

*Improvements and new features*
- Updated PDFium from `6462` (v4.30.0) rsp. `7323` (v5.0.0b2) to `7483`.
- Added `PdfPosConv` and `PdfBitmap.get_posconv(page)` helper for bidirectional translation between page and bitmap coordinates.
- Added `PdfObject.get_quad_points()` to get the corner points of an image or text object.
- Exposed `PdfPage.flatten()` (previously semi-private `_flatten()`), after having found out how to correctly use it. Added check and updated docs accordingly.
- With `PdfImage.get_bitmap(render=True)`, added `scale_to_original` option (defaults to True) to temporarily scale the image to its native pixel size. This should improve output quality and make the API substantially more useful. Thanks to Lei Zhang for the suggestion.
- Added context manager support to `PdfDocument`, so it can be used in a `with`-statement, because opening from a file path binds a file descriptor (usually on the C side), which should be released explicitly, given OS limits.
- If document loading failed, `err_code` is now assigned to the `PdfiumError` instance so callers may programmatically handle the error subtype. This addresses {issue}`308`.
- In `PdfPage.render()`, added a new option `maybe_alpha` to use a pixel format with alpha channel if page content has transparency, as rendering to a non-alpha bitmap is inefficient with PDFium in this case. Therefore, it is recommended to set this option to True if dynamic (page-dependent) pixel format selection is acceptable. Alternatively, you might want to use only BGRA via `force_bitmap_format=pypdfium2.raw.FPDFBitmap_BGRA` (at the cost of occupying more memory compared to BGR).
- In `PdfBitmap.new_*()` methods, avoid use of `.from_raw()`, and instead call the constructor directly, as most parameters are already known on the caller side when creating a bitmap.
- `PdfPage.remove_obj()` is now aware of objects nested in Form XObjects, and will use the new pdfium API `FPDFFormObj_RemoveObject()` in that case. Correspondingly, a `.container` attribute has been added to `PdfObject`, which points to the parent Form XObject, or None if the object is not nested.
- In the rendering CLI, added `--invert-lightness --exclude-images` post-processing options to render with selective lightness inversion. This may be useful to achieve a "dark theme" for light PDFs while preserving different colors, but goes at the cost of performance. (PDFium also provides a color scheme option, but this only allows you to set colors for certain object types, which are then forced on all instances of the type in question. This may flatten different colors into one, leading to a loss of visual information.)
- Corrected some null pointer checks: we have to use `bool(ptr)` rather than `ptr is None`.
- In `PdfDocument.save()`, changed default of `flags` from `FPDF_NO_INCREMENTAL` to `0`, as suggested by an upstream maintainer.
- Avoid creation of sized pointer types at runtime, to not blow up an unbounded pointer type cache of ctypes, which could effectively lead to a memory leak in a long-running application (i.e. do `(type * size).from_address(addressof(first_ptr.contents))` instead of `cast(first_ptr, POINTER(type * size)).contents`). Thanks to Richard Hundt for the bug report, {issue}`346`. The root issue (ctypes using an unbounded cache in the first place) has been fixed recently in Python `3.14`. See below for a list of APIs that were affected:
  * Anything using `_buffer_reader`/`_buffer_writer` under the hood (`PdfDocument` created from byte stream input, `PdfImage.load_jpeg()`, `PdfDocument.save()`).
  * `PdfBitmap.from_raw()` rsp. `PdfBitmap._get_buffer()` and their internal callers (`PdfBitmap` makers `new_foreign` and `new_foreign_simple`, `PdfImage.get_bitmap()`).
  * Also, some Readme snippets were affected, including the raw API rendering example. The Readme has been updated to mention the problem and use `.from_address(...)` instead.
  * *With older versions of pypdfium2/python, periodically calling `ctypes._reset_cache()` can work around this issue.*
- Improved startup performance by deferring imports of optional dependencies to the point where they are actually needed, to avoid overhead if you do not use them.
- Simplified version classes (no API change expected).

*Platforms*
- __Experimental__ Android (PEP 738) and iOS (PEP 730) support added.
  Android `arm64_v8a`, `armeabi_v7a`, `x86_64`, `x86` and iOS `arm64` device and `arm64`, `x86_64` simulators are now handled in setup and should implicitly download the right pdfium-binaries. Provided on a best effort basis, and largely untested. Testers/feedback welcome.
- pypdfium2's setup is now also capable of producing wheels for these platforms, but they will not actually be included in releases at this time. (Once Termux ships Python 3.13, we may want to publish Android `arm64_v8a` and maybe `armeabi_v7a` wheels, but we do not intend to provide wheels for simulators.)
- iOS will not actually work yet, as the PEP indicates binaries ought to be moved to a special Frameworks location for permission reasons, in which case you'd also have to patch pypdfium2's library search. We cannot do anything about this yet without access to a device or clearer instructions. Community help would be appreciated here.
- Added draft cibuildwheel workflow and configuration, as a second footing for the project (based on the native sourcebuild, see below). In the future, this may allow to stuff some Linux architecture gaps the *quick & dirty* way with emulation, or maybe new native runners. Many thanks to `wojiushixiaobai` for providing the initial workflow and helpful pointers.

*Setup*
- When pdfium binaries are downloaded implicitly on setup or `emplace.py` is run, we now pin the pdfium version by default. This is to prevent possible API breakage when pypdfium2 is installed from source. It should also make the `git` dependency optional on default setup. `update.py` and `craft.py` continue to default to the latest pdfium-binaries version.
- `pdfium-binaries` now use GitHub's new "immutable releases" feature and offer GitHub build provenance attestations, for enhanced supply chain safety. Many thanks to Benoit Blanchon and GitHub team. Conversely, `update.py` now exposes a `--verify` option to mandate checking the attestation, which is enabled in our release workflow. Otherwise, verification will be automatically enabled if the `gh` dependency is installed.
- We finally have a build script that works without Google's toolchain, and instead uses system tools/libraries (`build_native.py`). This has been inspired by the `libpdfium` COPR / `libpdfium-nojs` AUR recipes. Thanks to the respective packagers for showing how to do this. By default, this will use the GCC compiler, but Clang should also work if you set up some symlinks. As of this writing, both passes on our Ubuntu x84_64/arm64 CI.
- On host platforms not covered with `pdfium-binaries`, setup now looks for system/libreoffice pdfium. If this is not available either, `build_native.py` will be triggered. This can also be requested explicitly by setting `PDFIUM_PLATFORM` to `fallback`, `system-search` or `build-native`.
- Reworked setup to expose all targets through `PDFIUM_PLATFORM`. Added proper `system` staging directory. Refactored integration of caller-provided data files to avoid ambiguity. See the updated Readme for details.
- The toolchained build script continues to be available as well, but has been renamed from `sourcebuild.py` to `build_toolchained.py`.
- Both build scripts now pin pdfium to the version last tested by pypdfium2-team.
- With `build_toolchained.py --update`, avoid calling `gclient revert` and `gclient sync`, because this seems to sync twice, which is slow. Instead, call only `gclient sync` with `-D --reset`.
- With `pdfium-binaries`, read the full version from the `VERSION` file embedded in the tarballs. This avoids a potentially expensive `git ls-remote` call to get Chromium tags.
- Also added `GIVEN_FULLVER` and `IGNORE_FULLVER` env vars to manually set or skip the full version for other targets.
- Use build-specific license files collected by pdfium-binaries. Replaced outdated `LicenseRef-PdfiumThirdParty` with `BUILD_LICENSES/` directory.
- Take `PDFIUM_BINDINGS=reference` into account on sourcebuild as well. Automatically fall back to reference bindings if ctypesgen is not installed (except on CI).
- If packaging with `PDFIUM_PLATFORM=sourcebuild`, forward the platform tag determined by `bdist_wheel`'s wrapper, rather than using the underlying `sysconfig.get_platform()` directly. This may provide more accurate results, e.g. on macOS.
- Avoid needlessly calling `_get_libc_ver()`. Instead, call it only on Linux. A negative side effect of calling this unconditionally is that, on non-Linux platforms, an empty string may be returned, in which case the musllinux handler would be reached, which uses non-public API and isn't meant to be called on other platforms (though it seems to have passed).
- Collect libraries with globbing patterns in later setup pipeline. This is a prerequisite in case we want to split off separate DLLs for some dependency libraries in the future (e.g. libjpeg).

*Project*
- Replaced the bash `./run` file with a [`justfile`](https://github.com/casey/just). Note that the runfile previously did not fail fast and propagate errors, which is potentially dangerous for a release workflow. This had been fixed on the runfile in v5.0.0b1 before introducing the justfile.
- CI: Extended test matrices by Linux and Windows ARM64 (GH now provides free runners) and new Python versions.
- Merged `tests_old/` back into `tests/`.
- Migrated from deprecated `.reuse/dep5` to more visible `REUSE.toml`. Removed non-standard `.reuse/dep5-wheel`.
- Docs: Improved logic when to include the unreleased version warning and upcoming changelog.
- Bumped minimum pdfium requirement in conda recipe to `>6635` (effectively `>=6638`), due to new errchecks.
- Cleanly split out conda packaging into an own file, and confined it to the `conda/` directory, to avoid polluting the main setup code.


## 5.0.0b2 (2025-07-31)

- Updated PDFium from `6996` to `7323`.
- See the beta release notes on GitHub [here](https://github.com/pypdfium2-team/pypdfium2/releases/tag/5.0.0b2)


## 5.0.0b1 (2025-02-03)

- Updated PDFium from `6899` to `6996`.
- See the beta release notes on GitHub [here](https://github.com/pypdfium2-team/pypdfium2/releases/tag/5.0.0b1)


## 4.30.1 (2024-12-19)

**NOTE:** This release has been yanked on PyPI due to a text extraction regression introduced in pdfium `6756`. These problems are fixed as of pdfium-binaries `7019`.<br>
If you need any pypdfium2 improvements from this release, you can do e.g.
`PDFIUM_PLATFORM="auto:6462" pip install -v pypdfium2==4.30.1 --no-binary pypdfium2`
to install from the sdist with the previous pdfium version. Ideally, you'll want to migrate to v5.

- Updated PDFium from `6462` to `6899`.
- `PdfPage.get_objects()`: Don't register pageobjects as children, because they don't need to be closed by the caller when part of a page. This avoids excessive caching of weakrefs that are not cleaned up with the object they refer to.
- Fixed another dotted filepath blunder in the `extract-images` CLI. (The `PdfImage.extract()` API is not affected this time.)
- Adapted setup code to `bdist_wheel` relocation (moved from wheel to setuptools).
- Fixed installation with reference bindings (`PDFIUM_BINDINGS=reference`) by actually including them in the sdist and adding a missing `mkdir` call. (In older versions, this can be worked around by cloning the repository and creating the missing directory manually before installation.)
- Fixed sourcebuild on windows by syncing patches with pdfium-binaries.
- Updated test expectations: due to changes in pdfium, some numbers are now slightly different.
- Fixed conda packaging: It is now required to explicitly specify `-c defaults` with `--override-channels`, presumably due to an upstream change.
- Autorelease: Swapped default condition for minor/patch update, as pypdfium2 changes are likely more API-significant than pdfium updates. Added ability for manual override.
- Bumped workflows to Python 3.12.
- Updated docs on licensing.
- *This is expected to be the last release of the v4 series.*


## 4.30.0 (2024-05-09)

*Backported bug fixes / corrections from current development branch.*

- Updated PDFium from `6406` to `6462`.
- Fixed blunder in `PdfImage.extract()` producing an incorrect output path for prefixes containing a dot. In the `extract-images` CLI, this caused all output images of a type to be written to the same path for a document containing a non-extension dot in the filename.
- XFA / rendering CLI: Fixed incorrect recognition of document length. `pdf.init_forms()` must be called before `len(pdf)`.
- Made `get_text_range()` allocation adapt to pdfium version, as `FPDFText_GetText()` has been reverted to UCS-2. (See v4.28 changelog for background.)
- Updated workflows to include both `macos-13` and `macos-14` in test matrices because v13 is Intel and v14 ARM64 on GH actions. Removed python 3.7 testing because not supported anymore on `macos-14` runners.


## 4.29.0 (2024-04-10)

- Updated PDFium from `6337` to `6406`.


## 4.28.0 (2024-03-10)

- Updated PDFium from `6281` to `6337`.
- `get_text_range()`: Fixed a buffer size regression introduced in v4.26.0, caused by an unexpected behavior change in pdfium (thanks @elonzh for the bug report, {issue}`298`). Since that change, it is not possible anymore to tell the exact amount of memory needed, so we have to allocate for the worst case. Therefore, while this problem persists, it is recommended to instead use `get_text_bounded()` where possible.


## 4.27.0 (2024-02-10)

- Updated PDFium from `6233` to `6281`.
- Added ability to define `$CTYPESGEN_PIN` when building sdist via `./run craft pypi --sdist`, which allows to reproduce our sdists when set to the head commit hash of `pypdfium2-team/ctypesgen` at the time of the build to reproduce. Alternatively, you may patch the relevant `pyproject.toml` entry yourself and use `PDFIUM_PLATFORM=sdist python -m build --sdist` as usual.
- Set up Dependabot for GH Actions. Updated dependencies accordingly.


## 4.26.0 (2024-01-10)

- Updated PDFium from `6164` to `6233`.
- Pin ctypesgen in sdist to prevent re-occurrence of {issue}`264` / {issue}`286`. As a drawback, the pin is never committed, so the sdist is not simply reproducible at this time due to dependence on the latest commit hash of the ctypesgen fork at build time.
- Wheel tags: Added back `manylinux2014` in addition to `manylinux_{glibc_ver}` to be on the safe side. Suspected relation to the above issues.


## 4.25.0 (2023-12-10)

- Updated PDFium from `6110` to `6164`.
- Removed multiprocessing from deprecated `PdfDocument.render()` API and replaced with linear rendering. See below for more info.
- setup: Fixed blunder in headers cache logic that would cause existing headers to be always reused regardless of version. *Note, this did not affect release workflows, only local source re-installs.*
- Show path of linked binary in `pypdfium2 -v`.
- conda: Improved installation docs and channel config.
- conda/workflows: Added ability to (re-)build pypdfium2_raw bindings with any given version of pdfium. Fixes {issue}`279`.
- Made reference bindings more universal by including V8, XFA and Skia symbols. This is possible due to the dynamic symbol guards.
- Instruct ctypesgen to exclude some unused alias symbols pulled in from struct tags.
- Improved issue templates, added pull request template.
- Improved ctypesgen (pypdfium2-team fork).

#### Rationale for `PdfDocument.render()` deprecation

- The parallel rendering API unfortunately was an inherent design mistake: Multiprocessing is not meant to transfer large amounts of pixel data from workers to the main process.
- Bitmap transfer is so expensive that it essentially outweighed parallelization, so there was no real performance advantage, only higher memory load.
- As a related problem, the worker pool produces bitmaps at an independent speed, regardless of where the receiving iteration might be, so bitmaps could queue up in memory, possibly causing an enormeous rise in memory consumption over time. This effect was pronounced e.g. with PNG saving via PIL, as seen in Facebook's `nougat` project.
- Instead, each bitmap should be processed (e.g. saved) in the job which created it. Only a minimal, final result should be sent back to the main process (e.g. a file path).
- This means we cannot reasonably provide a generic parallel renderer; instead it needs to be implemented by callers.
- Historically, note that there had been even more faults in the implementation:
  * Prior to `4.22.0`, the pool was always initialized with `os.cpu_count()` processes by default, even when rendering less pages.
  * Prior to `4.20.0`, a full-scale input transfer was conducted on each job (rendering it unusable with bytes input). However, this can and should be done only once on process creation.
- pypdfium2's rendering CLI cleanly re-implements parallel rendering to files. We may want to turn this into an API in the future.

**Due to the potential for serious issues as outlined above, we strongly recommend that end users update and dependants bump their minimum requirement to this version. Callers should move away from `PdfDocument.render()` and use `PdfPage.render()` instead.**


## 4.24.0 (2023-11-10)

- Updated PDFium from `6097` to `6110`.
- Added GitHub issue templates.


## 4.23.1 (2023-10-31)

- No PDFium update.
- Fixed (Test)PyPI upload.


## 4.23.0 (2023-10-31)

*Note: (Test)PyPI upload failed for this release due to an oversight.*

- Updated PDFium from `6070` to `6097`.
- Fixed faulty version repr (avoid trailing `+` if desc is empty).
- Merged conda packaging code, including CI and Readme integration.
- Updated setup code, mainly to support conda.
  * Independent bindings cache. Download headers from pdfium. Extract archive members explicitly.
  * Cleaned up version integration of sourcebuild.
  * Changed `system` platform to generate files according to given version, instead of expecting given files.
  * Added `prepared!` prefix to platform spec, allowing to install with given files.
  * Added `PDFIUM_BINDINGS=reference` to use pre-built bindings when installing from source.
- Updated Readme.


## 4.22.0 (2023-10-19)

- Updated PDFium from `6056` to `6070`.
- Changed `PDFIUM_PLATFORM=none` to strictly exclude all data files. Added new target `system` consuming bindings and version files supplied by the caller.
- Enhanced integration of separate modules. This blazes the trail for conda packaging. We had to move metadata back to `setup.cfg` since we need a dynamic project name, which `pyproject.toml` does not support.
- Major improvements to version integration.
  * Ship version info as JSON files, separately for each submodule. Expose as immutable classes. Legacy members have been retained for backwards compatibility.
  * Autorelease uses dedicated JSON files for state tracking and control.
  * Read version info from `git describe`, providing definite identification.
  * If a local git repo is not available or `git describe` failed (e.g. sdist or shallow checkout), fall back to a supplied version file or the autorelease record. However, you are strongly encouraged to provide a setup that works with `git describe` where possible.
- Added musllinux aarch64 wheel. Thanks to `@jerbob92`.


## 4.21.0 (2023-10-11)

- Updated PDFium from `6002` to `6056`.
- `PdfTextPage.get_text_range()`: Correct the allocation in case of excluded/inserted chars, modify scope to prevent pdfium from reading beyond `range(index, index+count)` (which otherwise it does with leading excluded chars). Update docs to note the two different representations. Thanks to Nikita Rybak for the discovery ({issue}`261`).

- Setup changes (partly ported from the devel branch)
  * ctypesgen fork: replaced the old, bloated library loader with a new, lean version
  * Merged `$PDFIUM_VERSION` and `$PDFIUM_USE_V8` into the existing `$PDFIUM_PLATFORM` specifier (see Readme for updated description).
  * Removed the `build` package from pyproject buildsystem requires, where it was unnecessary. Thanks to Anaconda Team.
  * Split in two separate modules: pypdfium2 for helpers (pure-python), pypdfium2_raw for the core bindings (data files).

- Switched PyPI upload to "trusted publishing" (OIDC), which is considered safer. Further, the core maintainers have set up 2FA as requested by PyPI.

*Note: Earlier releases may fail to install from source due to API-breaking changes to our ctypesgen fork (see {issue}`264`). Where possible, avoid source installs and use the wheels instead (the default behavior). If you actually have to do this, consider `--no-build-isolation` and pre-installed dependencies, including ctypesgen prior to commit `61c638b`.*

*Warning: musllinux wheels prior to pdfium-binaries `6043` might be invalid.*


## 4.21.0b1 (2023-09-14)

- Updated PDFium from `5989` to `6002`.


## 4.20.0 (2023-09-10)

*This release backports some key fixes/improvements from the development branch*

- Updated PDFium from `5975` to `5989`.
- [V8/XFA] Fixed XFA init. This issue was caused by a typo in a struct field. Thanks to Benoît Blanchon.
- [ctypesgen fork] Prevent setting nonexistent struct fields.
- [V8/XFA] Expose V8/XFA exclusive members in the bindings file by passing ctypesgen the pre-processor defines in question.
- Fixed some major non-API implementation issues with multipage rendering:
  * Avoid full state data transfer and object re-initialization for each job. Instead, use a pool initializer and exploit global variables. This also makes bytes input tolerable for parallel rendering.
  * In the CLI, use a custom converter to save directly in workers instead of serializing bitmaps to the main process.
- Set pdfium version fields to unknown for `PDFIUM_PLATFORM=none` (sdist). This prevents encoding a potentially incorrect version. Also improve CLI version print.
- Fixed sourcebuild with system libraries.
- Fixed RTD build (`system_packages` option removal).
- Attempt to fix automatic GH pages rebuild on release.


## 4.19.0 (2023-08-28)

- Updated PDFium from `5868` to `5975`.
- Reset main branch to stable and shifted v5 development to a branch, so that pdfium updates (and possibly bug fixes) can still be handled. v5 development is delayed and unexpectedly tough, so this seemed necessary.
- The automated schedule has been slowed down from weekly to monthly for the time being. Further manual releases may be triggered as necessary.


## 4.18.0 (2023-07-04)

- Updated PDFium from `5854` to `5868`.


## 4.17.0 (2023-06-27)

- Updated PDFium from `5841` to `5854`.


## 4.16.0 (2023-06-20)

- Updated PDFium from `5827` to `5841`.


## 4.15.0 (2023-06-13)

- Updated PDFium from `5813` to `5827`.
- In helpers, closing a parent object now automatically closes the children to ensure correct order.
  This notably enhances safety of closing and absorbs the common mistake of closing a parent but missing child close calls. See commit [eb07605](https://github.com/pypdfium2-team/pypdfium2/commit/eb07605fcac124b4fe68f6baf60c86183170d259) for more info.
- In `init_forms()`, attempt to call `FPDF_LoadXFA()` and warn on failure, though as of this writing it always fails.


## 4.14.0 (2023-06-06)

- Updated PDFium from `5799` to `5813`.


## 4.13.0 (2023-05-30)

- Updated PDFium from `5786` to `5799`.


## 4.12.0 (2023-05-23)

- Updated PDFium from `5772` to `5786`.


## 4.11.0 (2023-05-16)

- Updated PDFium from `5758` to `5772`.
- In `PdfDocument.render()`, fixed a bad `bitmap.close()` call that would lead to a downstream use after free when using the combination of foreign bitmap and no-copy conversion. Using foreign bitmaps was not the default and expressly not recommended.


## 4.10.0 (2023-05-09)

- Updated PDFium from `5744` to `5758`.


## 4.9.0 (2023-05-02)

- Updated PDFium from `5731` to `5744`.


## 4.8.0 (2023-04-25)

- Updated PDFium from `5715` to `5731`.
- `PdfTextPage.get_rect()`: Added missing return code check and updated docs regarding dependence on `count_rects()`.
  Fixed related test code that was broken but disabled by accident (missing asserts). Thanks to Guy Rosin for reporting {issue}`207`.
- Added `PdfImage.get_size()` wrapping the new pdfium function `FPDFImageObj_GetImagePixelSize()`, which is faster than getting image size through the metadata.
- `build_pdfium.py --use-syslibs`: Changed `sysroot="/"` (invalid) to `use_sysroot=false` (valid). This allows us to remove a botched patch.


## 4.7.0 (2023-04-18)

- Updated PDFium from `5705` to `5715`.
- Fixed `PdfPage.remove_obj()` wrongly retaining the page as parent in the finalizer hierarchy.


## 4.6.0 (2023-04-11)

- Updated PDFium from `5692` to `5705`.


## 4.5.0 (2023-04-04)

- Updated PDFium from `5677` to `5692`.
- In pdfium-binaries, forms init for V8/XFA enabled builds was fixed by correctly setting up XFA on library init
  (see [pdfium-binaries#105](https://github.com/bblanchon/pdfium-binaries/issues/105)).
  Updated pypdfium2's support model accordingly.


## 4.4.0 (2023-03-28)

- Updated PDFium from `5664` to `5677`.


## 4.3.0 (2023-03-21)

- Updated PDFium from `5648` to `5664`.
- Fixed forms rendering in the multi-page renderer by initializing a formenv in worker jobs if the triggering document has one.


## 4.2.0 (2023-03-14)

- Updated PDFium from `5633` to `5648`.
- API-breaking changes around forms code, necessary to fix conceptual issues. Closes {issue}`182`.
  * `may_init_forms` parameter replaced with `init_forms()`, so that a custom form config can be provided.
  * `formtype` attribute replaced with `get_formtype()`.
    Previously, `formtype` would only be set correctly on formenv init, which caused confusion
    for documents that have forms but no formenv was initialized.
- `PdfPage.get_*box()` functions now provide an option to disable fallbacks. Closes {issue}`187`.
- Some formerly hidden utilities are now exposed in the new namespace `pypdfium2.internal`.


## 4.1.0 (2023-03-07)

- Updated PDFium from `5619` to `5633`.
- The `PdfDocument` parameter `may_init_forms` is now False by default.


## 4.0.0 (2023-02-28)

- Updated PDFium from `5579` to `5619`.
- Full support model rewrite. Many existing features changed and new helpers added. Numerous bugs fixed on the way.
  Read the updated documentation to migrate your code.
- The raw API is now isolated in a separate namespace (`pypdfium2.raw`).
  Moreover, the raw API bindings do not implicitly encode strings anymore (pypdfium2 is now built with a patched version of ctypesgen by default).
- Helper objects now automatically resolve to the underlying raw object if used as ctypes function parameter.
- Overhauled the code base to use `pathlib` and f-strings.
- Updated wheel tags.
- Improved command-line interface, setup code, and documentation.


## 4.0.0b2 (2023-02-23)

- First successful beta release for v4.


## 4.0.0b1 (2023-02-22)

- Attempted beta release for v4. PyPI upload failed due to {issue}`177`.


## History

pypdfium2 is on PyPI since Dec 3, 2021. New versions have been released on a regular basis ever since.

There have been the following version ranges: `0.1 - 0.15`, `1.0 - 1.11`, `2.0 - 2.11`, `3.0 - 3.21.1`.

Entries for releases below version 4 have been removed from the changelog because they were too inconsistent.
